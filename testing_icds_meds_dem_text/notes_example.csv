Z1,10/18/2020,12345,1,"age y.o. right handed man with a history of ?seizures beginning in month of year. He was refractory to medications and underwent a Phase I as well as Phase II investigation in the epilepsy monitoring unit. He underwent a right temporal lobectomy as well as a right frontal topectomy on month day, year. Since his surgery, he unfortunately has continued to have seizures. He had seen a marked improvement with Lamictal early in the year but that progress appears to have stalled.  We can't increase his Onfi as he had side effects at higher doses and the Lamictal appears at its maximum.  We will add Trileptal and see how he does.  If that is at all successful we will stop the Onfi.   Followed by neurologist. "
